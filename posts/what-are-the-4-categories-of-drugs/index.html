<p><strong>What Are The 4 Categories Of Drugs</strong>. All of the drugs out there all roughly fit into one of four major groups: While most prescription drugs/medicines also fit one of the other drug categories, many people assume that anything prescribed by a doctor is “different” from illegal drugs and carries no potential for harm. While some drugs may not fit exactly in any of the groups, these categories are currently the clearest and most accurate way to separate. What are the four types of drugs? Using schedule 3 drugs puts a person at a lower risk for developing a substance use disorder than schedule 1 and 2 drugs but at a higher risk than schedule 4 and 5 drugs.</p>

    <p>Stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, work in the opposite manner. The specific drug’s abuse rate is the major determinate aspect for drug scheduling. Amphetamines increase these levels by facilitating its outflow from nerve cells and interfering with its reuptake and breakdown by the cells. Some of the most commonly found types of drugs in society are depressants. There are two main types:</p>

While most prescription drugs/medicines also fit one of the other drug categories, many people assume that anything prescribed by a doctor is “different” from illegal drugs and carries no potential for harm. All of these drugs are potentially addicting and even deadly if misused. Here’s a complete list of all seven general categories of drugs according to their effect on users. What are the four types of drugs? Stimulants, such as caffeine or nicotine, work in the opposite manner. There are four different types of stimulant drugs. While some drugs may not fit exactly in any of the groups, these categories are currently the clearest and most accurate way to separate. Using schedule 3 drugs puts a person at a lower risk for developing a substance use disorder than schedule 1 and 2 drugs but at a higher risk than schedule 4 and 5 drugs. Opioids and opiates are confusing terms that many use interchangeably. They are substances that reduce arousal or brain stimulation, slowing down the body’s natural response and affecting coordination and concentration.</p>
